# Colors!

It works! It's aliiiiive.
Hello, and welcome to my simple but yet functional COLORS program. I am very much so a n00b so please be understanding.
Anywho, the program should do what God intended it to do: sort created objects by filtering for criterion (color in this
case).
Since Lonnie is probably the only person who will look at this, I would request that he not hesitate to suggest any 
changes, critique, ask for more functionalities, and/or implore me to beautify the GUI.

## USER GUIDE:

1. Run/open the program.
2. Along the top of the program window, you will see "File" and "Help" options.
3. Click/select "Help", then "Instructions".
4. Follow the instructions. If you do not want to do that, please go to #5.
5. Click/select "File", then "Open". This will read in the file and create Person objects.
6. If you click one of the seven buttons with colors listed on them, the program will gather all 
   persons with that color attribute and list them in the console output area.
7. If you click the button with the text "Click me to type in a color.", you will be prompted to 
   enter a color.
8. Enter one of seven possible colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. Case does not matter.
   The program will gather all persons with that color attribute and list them in the console output area.
   Also, all those persons and their corresponding attributes will be outputted to a file named "Sorted2.txt".
   
   
   **Note: You can click clear to close the file stream i.e. sever the connection between the program
   and the file it is reading.
   
   Thank you for using this guide.
